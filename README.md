# Cancer Drug Synergy Prediction using GNN and GCNN

---------------------------------


### Project Objective

Implementing deep learning techniques to compute synergy scores between two drugs for Cancer Treatment. We need to compute a viable score for a combination of drug effects on cancer cells.

Our models use the chemical structure of drugs and genomic information of various cancer cell lines as input information, a normalization strategy to justify the input data heterogeneity, and tapered layers to model drug synergies.
